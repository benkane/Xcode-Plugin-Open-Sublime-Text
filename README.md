Xcode Open In Sublime Text
==============================

![Open In Sublime Text](..)

Open In Sublime Text is a simple xcode plugin to quickly open a source file in Sublime Text from Xcode. Of course, you can just drag the file from the Xcode navigator onto the Sublime Text icon in your dock, but that's a lot of work. This plugin adds a `Open In Sublime Text` menu item to Xcode's Editor menu, which can be easily mapped to a convenient keyboard shortcut.
